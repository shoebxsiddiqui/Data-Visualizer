# Getting Started with D3.js

D3.js is a JavaScript library for creating visualizations like charts, maps, and more on the web.

> D3.js (also known as D3, short for Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standards. â€“ Wikipedia

Unlike many other data visualization libraries that provide ready made charts, D3 gives you lots of creative freedom as you have total control over the visualizations you create. D3 also uses web technologies like HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript.

In addition to the fact that D3 uses these familiar technologies, it has several other benefits:

* D3 is extremely fast,
* It encourages code reusability
* It supports large datasets and provides an easy way of loading and transforming data
* It's good for creating visualizations with rich interactions
